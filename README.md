This is my project known as Green Guide which is a front end development project.
I have done this by attending "IBM Skills Build Front End Development Virtual Internship" organised by Edunet foundation in collaboration with AICTE.
This is a 6 week internship in which I learnt how to clone a website.
The project aims to act as a guide to farmers about differnt crops.
It provides info about some crops and diseases.
Also if the farmer logins, he can send a query.
The functionality is only upto frontend service.
It uses only HTML, CSS and JS.
Initially there will be a login and signup page design, then crop info and a query form.
